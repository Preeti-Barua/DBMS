Transaction
The transaction is a set of logically related operation. It contains a group of tasks.
A transaction is an action or series of actions. It is performed by a single user to perform operations for accessing the contents of the database.
Example: Suppose an employee of bank transfers Rs 800 from X's account to Y's account. This small transaction contains several low-level tasks:


X's Account
Open_Account(X)  
Old_Balance = X.balance  
New_Balance = Old_Balance - 800  
X.balance = New_Balance  
Close_Account(X)  

Y's Account
Open_Account(Y)  
Old_Balance = Y.balance  
New_Balance = Old_Balance + 800  
Y.balance = New_Balance  
Close_Account(Y)
